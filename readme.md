# ansible-playbook-gitlab

Playbook for installing GitLab 7.1-stable on Ubuntu (tested with 12.04 i686 and 14.04 amd64).

Let's be honest, setting up gitlab is in pain in the ass. This ansible playbook was made to help you deploy GitLab in about 15 minutes with a single command.


## Prerequisites
You need to have sudo installed on the server and Ansible on the client.

You need to copy `vars.yml.example` to `vars.yml` which contains the domain you would like to use, as the database password.

_The playbooks use the apt module, and for that reason they only work on Debian-based distributions. They are currently only tested on Debian unstable. Patches are welcome for extending support for other platforms. Also, please let me know if the playbooks should happen to work on other configurations, such as Debian testing or Ubuntu Server._

## Installation

Run the following:

    ansible-playbook -vvv gitlab.yml -u ubuntu

The first time you will access the server, the loading time of the page will be quite long (>30s).
Once properly loaded, you should be able to log in with:

    username: root
    password: 5iveL!fe

## Next steps :

### Configure SMTP-out :
In order to configure SMTP-OUT, please copy the template config file and adjust the values accordingly

    cp /home/git/gitlab/config/initializers/smtp_settings.rb.sample /home/git/gitlab/config/initializers/smtp_settings.rb
    vi /home/git/gitlab/config/initializers/smtp_settings.rb 
    #save
    /etc/init.f/gitlab restart
